Homework2 was created using a Visual Studio console project. So this project will build but not run in Visual Studio itself.

In order to run this program it needs to be executed from the command line.

Steps:

-Navigate to the exe file in the project which should be in "Homework2\Debug\"

-In order to call the exe correctly some parameters need to be given in this order:

The executable itself
buffer size
source file name
Name of copied file to be named

Example:
.\Homework2.exe 2048 test.txt test2.txt

I have created a text file greater than 1MB for testing purposes although any file can be put there and copied.
